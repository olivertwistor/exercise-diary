## Background
There are plenty of exercise applications out there. So why make another? I 
have a disability and try to follow my physical therapy regimen. Since I don't 
like to do my exercise on certain days, it's hard to keep track of how much 
exercise I've done and still have left. So far I have been using an Excel 
spreadsheet and it works fine. However, I would like to be able to record my 
exercise on my smartphone instead of going to my computer. Editing Excel files 
on smartphones works, but it can be really finnicky.

I would want next month's exercise to be based on the exercise I have done in 
the last couple of months, in order to properly challenge me without feeling 
overwhelmed or the challenge being too easy. This is also possible to do in my 
Excel spreadsheet, but it's a pain to update.

## Purpose
The purpose of Exercise Diary is to provide a smartphone application that lets 
you track and follow up on your exercise and get personalised recommendations 
about future exercises based on your exercise history.
