## Background
There are plenty of exercise applications out there. So why make another? I 
have a disability and try to follow my physical therapy regimen. Since I don't 
like to do my exercise on certain days, it's hard to keep track of how much 
exercise I've done and still have left. So far I have been using an Excel 
spreadsheet and it works fine. However, I would like to be able to record my 
exercise on my smartphone instead of going to my computer. Editing Excel files 
on smartphones works, but it can be really finnicky.

I would want next month's exercise to be based on the exercise I have done in 
the last couple of months, in order to properly challenge me without feeling 
overwhelmed or feel that the challenge is too easy. This is also possible to do 
in my Excel spreadsheet, but it's a pain to update.

Why don't I use another smartphone app instead of an Excel spreadsheet? Most 
exercise apps I have tried is cloud based services, so they require people to 
create a user account, many of them have quite many features such as GPS 
support. I don't need that and I don't want to have to log in to a service to 
record my exercise. I want a simple to use, off-line app. So far I haven't 
found one I'm comfortable with using.

## Purpose
The purpose of Exercise Diary is to provide a smartphone application that lets 
you track and follow up on your exercise and get personalised recommendations 
about future exercises based on your exercise history.

## Goal
The goal of Exercise Diary is to make an Android app that:

* provides the ability to enter details about your exercise
* provides the ability to see statistics of your exercise history and to export 
it to various file types (such as CSV)
* can recommend an exercise schedule for you based on previous exercise

## Stakeholders
The primary stakeholders of Exercise Diary would be people who wants an easy 
way to record their exercise on their smartphones, without the need of all 
bells and whistles of other apps.
